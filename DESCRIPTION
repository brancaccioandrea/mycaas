Description: This package implements adaptive assessment procedures based on Knowledge Space Theory (KST) and Formal Psychological Assessment (FPA) frameworks. 
      An adaptive assessment is a type of evaluation that adjusts the difficulty and nature of subsequent questions based on the test-taker's responses to previous ones.The package contains functions to perform and simulate an adaptive assessment. Moreover, it is integrated with two R Shiny interfaces, making it both accessible and user-friendly. 
      The package has been funded by the European Union - NextGenerationEU and by the Ministry of University and Research (MUR), National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4, Component 2, Investment 1.5, project “RAISE - Robotics and AI for Socio-economic Empowerment” (ECS00000035).
