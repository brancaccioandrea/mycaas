Description: Implementation of adaptive assessment procedures based
    on Knowledge Space Theory (KST) and Formal Psychological Assessment
    (FPA) frameworks.  An adaptive assessment is a type of evaluation that
    adjusts the difficulty and nature of subsequent questions based on the
    test-taker's responses to previous ones.The package contains functions
    to perform and simulate an adaptive assessment. Moreover, it is
    integrated with two 'Shiny' interfaces, making it both accessible and
    user-friendly.  The package has been funded by the European Union -
    NextGenerationEU and by the Ministry of University and Research (MUR),
    National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4, Component 2,
    Investment 1.5, project “RAISE - Robotics and AI for Socio-economic
    Empowerment” (ECS00000035).
